Here, you can do a whole range of "occult" things, some more advanced/involved than others; execute or augement rituals (especially astral), utilize the dialogue as a communion amplifier during evocations or invocations, offer prayers/requests/praise/worship, fuck around, explore your unconscious mind, seed intuition, interact with your inner daemon (genius/HGA), etc...</p>

                                        The School is called <b>NuChwezi Esoteric School</b>, and we are currently located in <b>Uganda, East Africa</b>. But, online, this is where the true seeker can be led to wisdom undefiled; about how to learn and practice magick on their own. We give special focus to black magick, witchcraft, shamanism and the other more serious paths. Serious students might also get a chance to contact our adepts, for a chance to get mentored, or even get evaluated for initiation into one of a couple of Esoteric Orders we work with.

                                        <h2>The NUCHWEZI ESOTERIC SCHOOL (NES) presents <b>The First Principles</b></h2>
                                        <p>This section won't offer you a full curriculum into the mysteries, nor a total grasp of magick or the other occult arts, but will try to give enough primers and general principles to inspire you to seek further, so you can start making sense of the more arcane stuff elsewhere.</p>
                                        <hr/>
                                        <p>The following are well known to most initiates, but for those new to these arts and sciences, here are some potent principles to get started with:
                                        <ul style="font-size:16px">
                                            <li>Magick doesn't work. Your Magick, is what works!</li>
                                            <li>Faith is fundamental, it's the tool.</li>
                                            <li>The subjective universe is more important, is a part of the absolute cosmos, and shapes it as well.</li>
                                            <li>A thing holds as much power relative to you, as your subconscious and the collective unconcious attributes to it - you might not always be able to reason away such power, no matter what.</li>
                                            <li>Attention offered a thing, confers power upon it.</li>
                                            <li>The imagination is infinitely more powerful than reason.</li>
                                            <li>What exists for your mind, exists palpably for you.</li>
                                            <li>Magick works. That doesn't mean you understand how it works.</li>
                                            <li>As Above, So it is Below. Only fools underestimate the power of symbols.</li>
                                            <li>Words manifest thoughts, which manifest things in the psyche, which influence the cosmos.</li>
                                            <li>Symbols carry all the power the psyche needs to manifest the power they represent.</li>
                                            <li>Magick is like fire - you can cook food with it, but can also get burnt by it. Respect the Archetypes.</li>
                                            <li>Nothing is True. Everything is permitted.</li>
                                            <li>You can't cause change by wishing, only by desiring, willing, and acting. Seek, Dare, and Act.</li>
                                            <li>If you can perfect your fantasy, it will become reality as a must.</li>
                                            <li>All the power lies in you - already. Damn, do the magick yourself!</li>
                                            <li>If you can, spend time around little kids as they play and explore unhindered - you'll meet the best living mages, and be inspired beyond what you might be able to find anywhere else. Most of all, attempt to reanimate the child within you.</li>
                                            <li>The unconscious creates, the conscious edits.</li>
                                            <li>Reading books can only seed you with ideas - never can it get you the actual results. Only by putting things into context, adapting and even breaking/bending the rules to your own style and inclinations, can you tap into the potent stream that others deem to be tradition. Improvisation, experiment and persistence - kicking out what doesn't work soon as you find it to be rubbish.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        </p>
                                        <hr/>

                                        <p>And then, we have the following extra principles, that are key to understanding or leveraging the sort of magick that empowered our predecessors, The Chwezi (BaChwezi), who were not only eminent in magick, but were overall more creative and superior than any other tribal/ethnic group they came into contact with:
                                        <ul style="font-size:16px">
                                            <li>You might not acknowledge it, but you possess schisms in your psyche - it's a feature.</li>
                                            <li>The aliens that matter the most, are the kind that can be evoked or invoked before or into the psyche. Thus the importance of familiarization and using proper symbolism</li>
                                            <li>Finding or rather, identifying, and then working with your inner daemon/genius/HGA/HGD/Djinni... is a critical step in the pursuit of true, higher attainment - the domain doesn't matter.</li>
                                            <li>To a lesser or greater extent, everyone is possessed by something other than what they regard to be their "self" - again, this can be approached as a feature, and this is what lays the foundation for working with the <b>magick of possession</b>, as practiced by the Chwezi before us, and all other eminent systems of the kind worldwide.</li>
                                            <li><i>Something specific, lurks within and transcends "you" - coming into possession of this other, transcendental self, is the key to this work.</i></li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Finally, assuming you were to abandon all the other principles (above), and just stick to a single, most potent, most pragmatic, most modern principle, which one would that be? At NES, we would most likely propose the following...
                                        <ul style="font-size:16px">
                                            <li><b>Acknowledge your unconscious mind, and then work with it, not against it.</b></li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <hr/>

In the spirit of ancient and modern LHP work, the use of sigils and seals when dealing with these dark powers is a potent tool.

Likewise, you can make suggestions, propose features or improvements to the shrine technology, share your experiences using it, request for help with your own magick or studies of it, etc. Also, because there have been some interesting requests for contract magick, we decided to put a category for such requests as well, but, before making a request concerning help
                                        spells, exercises or troubleshooting aspects of your esoteric work, try to visit the school section, and consult some of the fine books we've proposed for students and practitioners. There's a lot to be learnt and to be done, especially when you start to get practical.

                                        If you've found this shrine technology interesting, or if you'd like to explore more of the ideas we are experimenting with, in the domains between science, technology and magick, then you'll definitely want to find out more about the tech department at the NuChwezi Esoteric School.
                                        </p>
                                        <hr/>
                                        <p>Our labs currently explore the following aspects of magick, using technology
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Seeding Divination - especially as it relates to controlling and enhancing sources of randomness in divining techniques - with a special interest in exploring uses of atmospheric phenomena, and computer-aided randomness, as sources of bias vs classical, operator induced sources.</li>
                                            <li>Divination Interfaces - with strong interest in astral-visual induction as used in various scrying systems</li>
                                            <li>Divination with Quantifiable Data - curiousities in potential applications of statistics in augementing divinations (think, shammans with BIG Data)</li>
                                            <li>Computer-Aided Scrying and Automatic Writting - using lexicons in alphanumeric sortilege, synthesis of projected communication using pre-existing alphabets/lexicons, etc.</li>
                                            <li>Quantifiable, falsifiable magick - using statistics, the scientific method and rigorous magical journaling for cutting the bullshit out of magick, and exposing repeatable formulae, points of failure in ritual, testing Probabilistic Models of Magick (see Peter J. Caroll's work), and more... To support this noble and ambitious approach to magick, we have built an advanced magick journalling platform that can support not just individuals, but
                                                entire orders/classes of students, with in-built analysis facilities.</li>
                                            <li>Occult languages - exploring linguistics, communication-psychology and information representation (symbolism), from the perspective of exploring and hacking conscious-mind filters, exploiting subconscious-mind concept-maps, non-verbal communication, etc.</li>
                                            <li>Cryptography - closely linked with most esoteric and occult work, we are particularly interested in applications of stealth, without-machine encryption methods such as crypto using combos of ciphers or impromptu symbol systems (sigils) and steganography</li>
                                            <li>HCI -- definitely, as we draw closer and closer to mainstream adoption of VR, there's strong, keen interest in exploring the potential of leveraging augemented reality or even entirely virtual realities, to enhance, evolve and synthesize new forms of magick, ritual and mystic experiences. However, we are awaiting the chance to get our hands on a VR Console, to get our hands dirty in this exciting area of future, pragmatic magick.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <hr/>
                                        <p>Outside of the magick-technology arena, we definitely do carry-out more traditional esoteric research, and the following are some key areas of interest:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Re-classification of and refinining of African traditional pantheons, so as to enhance the accuracy/efficacy of evocational work and to aid in fitting the native mythos into a more universal correspondence framework. In this regard, most focus is currently on the East African pantheons of the Chwezi & Tembuzi divinities</li>
                                            <li>Weather modification rituals - especially because, more than ever, climate change poses a big problem to our people everywhere, and there's much hope that keeping the ancient lines of work in esoteric meteorology, could still be worth it. Our focus is mostly on seeding, starting and stoppping rain, as well as the induction and control of turbulent weather locally and remotely (via symbolic machines).</li>
                                            <li>Evocational Magick - more serious than most other work we are doing, is the active exploration of various evocational systems, in the hope of reanimating and rejuvenating many dying native pantheons that used to be of potent significance in the collective African Mind. In this domain, we don't limit work to interlucustrine pantheons, but explore as fas as the Bantu mythos of Sub-saharan, South and West Africa. This is one area where
                                                the need for more collaboration and formalization of the craft is much needed - much of the wisdom is endangered.</li>
                                            <li>Black Magick - self-deification is the end. But, along the way, there's exploration of the "darker" aspects of the pysche; psychopathology, paranormal psychology,  adversarial and theurapeutic unorthodox psychological work, dealing with such aspects of the mind as complexes, shadow-selves, the Id, alter-egos, projected personas and more... much of the work is geared towards uncovering a more universal framework for efficacious conduction of black
                                                magick (think deep, personal transformation), using whatever dark tools are available.</li>
                                            <li>Sex Magick - in more private work, there's strong interest in, and practical exploration of the associations between creative potential of the psyche (especially issues around psychic-energy as it relates to ideation and motivation), free-association power, visual-thinking, and then the more mystical, magical aspects of creating in the astral (lots to do with ideation and perpetuation of elements in the psyche), etc, and how these things relate
                                                to sexual-expression and suppression of it, libido, and the unconscious in general.</li> 
                                            <li>Music and Magick - there's a keen interest in the exploration and application of musical expression, in encoding payloads for the unconscious, enhancing or altering emotional states during ritual, concepts of universal communication - as stronger means of altering mind-states without cognitive interference, etc. </li>
                                        </p>
                                        <hr/>
                                        <p>The above isn't doing justice to the breadth and depth of work we are doing in the domains of pragmatic esotericism, but it gives you a fair idea of of what NES is, and what it's not. For those who are already engaged in these or more advanced forms of magick and esoteric work, we'd surely love to get in-touch, and perhaps even collaborate on some domains of mutual interest. Being influenced heavily by the Chaos, Tactical Magick stream, we don't really
                                        have localized research stations, and have much of the work geographically scattered among our normadic shammans and students. Contact us, if you desire to work in an area we might be near to - Africa especially.</p>

So, this little tool, a bit tricky for anyone impatient to explore it without digging-deeper, is very handy for deviant mages that wish to curate or exchange secrets in unsafe, but otherwise innocent media - beware of poets! This can be useful in composing sensitive sections
                                                        of grimoires, journals and such. Definitely, proper use would not only require understanding it, but also customizing it based on domain and nature of threat.</p>

It's an attempt to evolve the traditional shamman shrine and altar a virtual, digital domain - similar to what astral temples would do for the same, in terms of ubiquity and improvisation. We also wish to see more Africans revisit their ancient practices of communing with ancenstral spirits, deities and more, directly from the comfort of their homes
                                                        (and work-places), as was the case when every family and shelter used to have an altar or a shrine somewhere. We desire to support and evolve the next generation of cyber-shammans, as well as bring witchcraft and magick well into the modern, hyper-tech world we are continually morphing into.

                                        <p>On the less technical side, we have these other projects and experiments that border on cultural and media experiments with magick and esotericism. A key motivator for these other projects is activism, curation of occult wisdom and arts, evolving of occult themes in our culture, and definitely doing a little more magick in alternate ways...</p>

                                                        <p>One of the most prominent things about the occult revival in the 20th and 21-Century is how liberal and ubiquitous occult literature has become. Gone are the days when a potential student would have to risk their lives crossing forest and deserts in Africa, in search of the lessons and wisdom of ancient and contemporary masters. Today, the richness of the last couple centuries of esoteric work, is all but a search and a click away
                                                        for most kinds of eso literature. But, unlike the rest of the world, there's very little (to nearly no) documentation, formalization and perpeuity of African esotericism - especially as explored and applied natively. This project, which is on the general side a platform to stimulate and nurture reading and writing in Africa, is also biased towards doing this, for the more marginalized, stigmatized forms of writing in Africa
                                                        today - writing about magick, witchcraft and other things the popular mindset has been brainwashed to disregard or steer away from - thanks to materialism and decades of Christianization of our peoples.</p>

                                                        <p>There's not really any book in existence that properly captures the vast wealth of mystery, power and grandeur that are imbued in the original, and some surviving forms of native African occult practice. This is more true, of the regions of East and Sub-saharan Africa. So, to deviate from what anthropologists and apologetic scholars have done while treating the subjects of Occultism and native mystery traditions, one of our own, is
                                                        working on an epic Novel, that traces a deep and enthralling story into one of the most mysterious domains of African Black Magick - the Chwezi Initiatory Cults of Bunyoro-Kitara. Updates about where and when to purchase this epic book will be made available once the project is done - which should be either later this year, or early 2017</p>
