# BLACK SHRINES - welcome black to the shrines of our gods

The online shrine technology, school and community of black and dark arts as sponsored by the NuChwezi Esoteric School of Uganda, East Africa.

# Current Features:

At NES, we believe in leveraging technology to serve higher and spiritual ends - these are ancient African ethos. Currently, this shrine technology boosts the following features:

**Shrines**:

- 10 dynamic, interactive, fire-filled black shrines:
  - The Black Gods - Tahuti, Set, Nyamiyonga, and Enkya Ya Enkya
  - The Dark Gods - Satan, Lucifer, Leviatan and Belial
  - The Beast
  - Your Inner Daimons  
- Music for each shrine - hand-selected to evoke the right state of mind while in the given shrine.
- Fire. Yes, each shrine has enough fire to keep you both warm and empowered all through the experience.
- Mantras - dynamic, each shrine/God with theirs - meant to be good focus for meditations and as stimuli for inner-work.
- God Messages: forget your mainstream shrines and their silent gods! In our shrines, when you speak to a deity/spirit, you soon get a response back - just, you might not always be able to make sense of the response. We also leverage ciphers and possibly True Randomness - Random.org when online, your default JS Random source when offline.
- We leverage symbolic language, hermetic color correspondences and more...

**The School**

Not really an online school as such - that will have it's own place eventually. There's a presentation of some of the fundamental principles taught at the NuChwezi Esoteric School, as well as a selection of special books meant to be readily accessed by students of the LHP and the other dark/blacker arts and sciences as are taught at NES.

There's a fine selection of books aimed at grounding you in the practical and theoretical aspects of pragmatic black magick. We try not to give a particular system precendence, but believe that with a good understanding of the material presented, one ought be versatile in any forms of the art and science. 

**The Community**

Those who visit the shrines or the other places on the platform, can also spend some time chatting with others on topics of interest, directly on the site.

**Consultation**

There might be visitors that have one or more requests to make, questions to ask or information to provide.

Overall, this is a good home for the progressive LHP seeker and student, as well as the deviant believer in you...
